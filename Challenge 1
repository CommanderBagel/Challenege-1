#  Goal #1: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
#  Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn
#  100 years old.

print('What is you name?')  #This asks the user's name
UserName = input()          #The user's name is now the value UserName and is a String
 
print('Thanks User ' + UserName + '.') #This line displays Thanks to the given name.


print('Please enter your age:')
UserAge = input()

print('Your age is: ' + UserAge + ' years old.')

#  print('User ' + UserName + ', you will be 100 years old in ' + str(100 - int(UserAge)) + ' years and the year will be ' + str((100 - (int(UserAge)) + int(CurYear))))
print('User ' + UserName + ', you will be 100 years old in the year ' + str(int(2020 - int(UserAge) + 100)))


#  Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
#  Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

print('Just for gags, pick a number' + '\n') #, any number less than 100 but greater than 0')
Num = input()
print(('Your number is ' + str(Num) + '\n') * int(Num))

print('Done, Sir, Done!')


# Would this code have to be updated "annually" to reflect a correct year or rely on user data?
